Determining the severity of upper-extremity motor impairment in chronic stroke survivors using Fugl-Meyer Score â€“ A cluster analytical approach

Our project aimed to the determine severity of the stroke-related upper extremity impairment using the Upper Extremity Scale of the Fugl-Meyer (UEFM). THe results from our clustering-based analytical approach support a four-group motor impairment classification in chronic stroke survivors with upper extremity weakness.
